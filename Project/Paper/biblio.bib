 abstract = {We consider large double auctions with private values. Values need be neither symmetric nor independent. Multiple units may be owned or desired. Participation may be stochastic. We introduce a very mild notion of "a little independence." We prove that all nontrivial equilibria of auctions that satisfy this notion are asymptotically efficient. For any Î± > 0, inefficiency disappears at rate $1/n^{2-\alpha}$.},

title = "Sorting through Search and matching models in economics",
abstract = "Toward understanding assortative matching, this is a self-contained introduction to research on search and matching. We first explore the nontransferable and perfectly transferable utility matching paradigms, and then a unifying imperfectly transferable utility matching model. Motivated by some unrealistic predictions of frictionless matching, we flesh out the foundational economics of search theory. We then revisit the original matching paradigms with search frictions. We finally allow informational frictions that often arise, such as in college-student sorting.",

 abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

 abstract = {Quantile regression methods are suggested for a class of ARCH models. Because conditional quantiles are readily interpretable in semiparametric ARCH models and are inherently easier to estimate robustly than population moments, they offer some advantages over more familiar methods based on Gaussian likelihoods. Related inference methods, including the construction of prediction intervals, are also briefly discussed.},
