** The Problem

- People are randomly distributed items in the game. 
- They have private valuations for each item that are not known to the
  designers
- A market is created in order to ensure an efficient outcome.
- Takes the form of a double auction - converging to competitive equilibrium

** Matching
- One context to think of the problem as one of matching individuals
  in order to maximize the total surplus. 
- We know from Micro2 that this is equivalent to thinking about a
  decentralized market. 
- The Objective function is valuation of the buyers and the sellers

** Who Gets What
- Both buyers and sellers have the same distribution of valuations
- However, the masses of the buyers and sellers are not equal.
- Only some percentage are endowed with the item
- Market is efficient - highest valuations end up with the item.

** The Planner's Problem
\begin{align*}
\max_{\alpha_{i,j}} & \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J \left ( V_i - V_j ) \alpha_{i,j} \\
\text{subject to: } & \forall j, 1 \leq j \leq J \quad \sum_{i=1}^I \alpha_{i,j} \leq 1 \\
& \forall i, 1 \leq i \leq I \quad \sum_{j=1}^J \alpha_{i,j} \leq 1\\
\end{align*}

** Planner's Problem (cont)
- The solution to this is not unique.
- The difference in valuations is both sub and super-modular. This
  implies that both PAM and NAM are supported, and all permutations
  between the sellers and buyers selected are supported.
- This means we know who is matched but not with whom.

** The dual
 
\begin{align*}
\min_{x,j} & \sum_{i=1}^I x_i + \sum_{j=1}^J y_j \\
\text{subject to: } & \forall i,j; \quad 1 \leq j \leq J, \quad 1 \le i \leq I\\
& x_i + y_j \geq V_i - V_j \\ 
\end{align*}

- This has a unique solution - for each buyer and seller it gives the
  shadow price: the surplus that each commands.
- Becuase the function is modular, the valuation plus the surplus for
  all sellers is equal - this is the price the market supports.

** Unequal Buyers and Sellers

** Equilibrium
- Let the proportion of the population that recieved the item be
  denoted \xi.
- For normally distributed valuations, the price is defined by:

\begin{align*}
\Phi \left ( \frac{ p^* - \mu }{\sigma} \right ) &= \frac{1-\xi}{\xi} \left [ 1 - \Phi \left
( \frac{ p^* - \mu }{\sigma} \right ) \right ]\\
p^* &= \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1} ( 1- \xi )\\
\end{align*}


** Known \xi
- If we knew \xi, this model could be estimated via linear regression
- Can handle even if there is measurement error in calculating \xi.
- However, even if we know the quantity of sales, and the number of
  people playing, no idea of people engaging in the market.
- Need to use the price to endogenize \xi.

** Dynamic Approach
- Let this process repeat over many time intervals. 
- Assume no entry into the market. 
- Since this market is efficient, the top portion of the buyers always
  purchases the item, and the price slowly falls
- This can only support a decreasing price.

** A Simulation
- $\mu = 35, \sigma = 10, \xi = .01, N = 1000$
[[../Scripts/PriceOverTime.png]]

** Specification
\begin{align*}
q_s &= N \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} (1-\xi_t ) \xi_T \frac{\Phi \left ( \frac{ p - \mu }{\sigma} \right )}{ \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} ( 1 - \xi_t ) }\\
q_d &= N \prod_{t=0}^{T} ( 1- \xi_t ) \left [ 1 - \frac{ \Phi \left ( \frac{
p - \mu }{ \sigma } \right ) }{ \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} (1 - \xi_t ) } \right ]\\
\log ( p_T^* ) &= \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1} \left [ \prod_{t=0}^T ( 1 - \xi_t ) \right ]\\
q_T^* &= N \prod_{t=0}^T ( 1 - \xi_t ) \xi_T \\
\log ( p^* ) &= \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1} \left [ \frac{ q^* }{ N \xi_T} \right ]\\
\end{align*}


** Problems with Data
- This model cannot support the prices increasing.
- One possibility is to add white noise, which increases the variance
  on all observations, and can explain some jumps in prices
- This cannot explain trends in prices that are observed in some items.
- Worse yet, it predicts price to eventually fall to zero, which is
  not represented by most items

** What can we predict?
- We are predicting the price to eventually drop to zero, but we do
  not have an equilibirum specification. So for data where the price
  is driven on a downward trend, we can estimate the data. 
- We still need some sort of identifying assumption on \xi.
- Choose to hold it constant over over a month.
- Then estimate the values of \mu and \sigma using Linear Regression or Least
  Absolute Deviations.

** Some Predictions
[[../Plots/Cases/NoGrowth/Spectrum Case.pdf]]

** Market Entry
- For the price to be able to increase, there must be new people
  entering the market.
- Let \lambda_t denote the percent of new entrants into the market.
- Since each new entrant has the original valuations, we must consider
  all owners of the item, even past owners.
- This leads to both buyers and sellers having a mixing distribution
  of valuations

** Masses of Buyers and Sellers
\begin{align*}
M_B(T) &= N (1-\xi_T ) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} ( 1 - \xi_t + \lambda_t ) \\
M_S(T) &= N \sum_{i = 0}^T \xi_i \prod_{t=0}^{i-1} ( 1- \xi_t + \lambda_t )\\
M_B(T) &= N B_T ( p_T )\\
M_S(T) &= N \left ( 1 - B_T(p_T) + \sum_{t=1}^{T-1}  R_{t}(\lambda,p) \right )\\
R_i(\lambda,p) &= \lambda_i \left [ B_{i-1}(p_{i-1} ) + R_{i-1}(\lambda, p) \right ]\\
R_0 (\lambda,p) &= \lambda_0 \\
\end{align*}

** Valuations of Buyers and Sellers
\begin{align*}
B_T (p) &= \frac{ B_{T-1 }(p_{T-1}) }{ B_{T-1 }(p_{T-1}) + \lambda_1 } \min \left \{ 1, \frac{ B_{T-1} ( p ) }{B_{T-1 }(p_{T-1 })} \right \}\\
 & \quad + \frac{ \lambda_1 }{ B_{T-1 }(p_{T-1}) + \lambda_1 } B_0 (p) \\
S_T (p) &= \frac{ M_S(T-1) }{ M_S(T) } \max \left \{ 0, \frac{ B_{T-1}(p) - B_{T-1}( p_{T-1} ) }{ 1 - B_{T-1} ( p_{T-1} ) } \right \}\\
 & \quad + \frac{ M_S(T) - M_S(T-1)_{} }{M_S(T)} B_T (p)\\
\end{align*}


- $B_t(p)$ and $S_t(p)$ are strictly increasing functions of p, so the
  intersection between $q_d, q_s$ is uniquely defined.
** Problems
- There are some serious identificaiton problems with this
model
- What changes are caused by \xi, and what by \lambda? 
- Assumptions such as holding each fixed within a month are
  ineffective
- Worse yet, all attempts seem to drive the estimated variance to infinty.

** Non-Constant Valuations
- While the valuation of some items in the game might remain constant
- Items of interest such as the loot boxes have their values
  influenced by the prices of the items contained. 
- Of interest is the magnitude of this over the lifetime of the item
- Use the fact that the distribution of the items reveals the
  quantiles of the distribution

** Quantile Regression
- In the model without any growth: 
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{t=0}^T ( 1- \xi_t) &= F_V \left ( p^* \right )
\end{equation*}
- The proportion of people given the item reveals quantiles of the
  true valuations.

** Quantile Regression
- If we want to remain agnostic about the percent of people given the
  item, the only choice we have is to examine how different quantiles
  of the pricing distribution are affected.
- This involves quantile regression, and abandoning many of the
  structural results hoped for.
- One approach is to estimate many different quantiles and plot them

** Loot box Averages
[[../Plots/SepEstimate.pdf]]

** A Slightly more Sophisticated Approach
- Multiple Quantile Regression can allow for non-parametric estimates
  of the effects, or for more efficient estimates of the quantiles
  affects.
- Mutlivariate Quantile Regression can allow for shared effects
  between boxes, as applying quantile regression to the price data for
  the boxes combined is not reasonable.
- Wish to fix the effect of the presence of items across the boxes,
  while allowing the other affects to change over quantiles

** A Specification
- Let $\beta$ be the shared effects, and \delta be the non-shared effects.
\begin{align*}
\min & \sum_{i=0}^I \tau 1^T u_i + (1-\tau) 1^T v_i \\
\text{ s.t. } &X ( \beta + \delta_i ) + u_i - v_i = Y_i \quad \forall i \in I\\
&u_i \geq 0, v_i \geq 0\\
\end{align*}
