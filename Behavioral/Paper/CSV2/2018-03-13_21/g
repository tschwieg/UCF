     ‘predict’ is a generic function for predictions from the results
     of various model fitting functions.  The function invokes
     particular _methods_ which depend on the ‘class’ of the first
     argument.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     predict (object, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: a model object for which prediction is desired.

     ...: additional arguments affecting the predictions produced.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Most prediction methods which are similar to those for linear
     models have an argument ‘newdata’ specifying the first place to
     look for explanatory variables to be used for prediction.  Some
     considerable attempts are made to match up the columns in
     ‘newdata’ to those used for fitting, for example that they are of
     comparable types and that any factors have the same level set in
     the same order (or can be transformed to be so).

     Time series prediction methods in package ‘stats’ have an argument
     ‘n.ahead’ specifying how many time steps ahead to predict.

     Many methods have a logical argument ‘se.fit’ saying if standard
     errors are to returned.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The form of the value returned by ‘predict’ depends on the class
     of its argument.  See the documentation of the particular methods
     for details of what is produced by that method.
