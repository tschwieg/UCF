** Different reference dependence

In this section I consider the model if individuals consider gains and
losses as relative to the expected value of the crates and the price
they paid to open the crates. Effectively, the refrence point simply
has the expected value of the crate subtracted from the value, that
is: instead of viewing gains and losses as relative to the initial
income of the opener, if we consider them as gains and losses relative
to what is expected to gain, a much different picture emerges.

| Likelihood: | -2.389256828231863 x 10^6 |
| \lambda           |          1.48236 x 10^-11 |
| \alpha           |                      0.0 |
| \delta           |                 0.108213 |

While the same results for \lambda and \alpha are present, that is there is no
loss aversion, and the valuation shape is approaching an indicator
function on whether or not it is a gain, the probability weighting
function has a much different value. This has distorted its shape
massively, lowering the function except for the very high valued
items.

This begins to explain buying patterns in these crates, as it seems to
imply that the low value items do not matter at all, and that the very
rare items that have extremely low probabilities are massively
overweighted. This is consistent with the notion that only the very
rare high value items are driving the prices for the crates. It would
imply that losses opened from the crates are simply consolation
prizes, and their value is irrelevant. However I am reluctant to say
that this model fully explains the patterns of valuations because of
the lack of convexity of the valuation function, whose shape has not
changed. I believe that an extreme distortion of the probabilities is
occurring, as shown much more by this intrepretation of the structure
of the reference point. There are still aspects of the valuation not
explained by this particular form, nor by any form that I was able to
fit while maintaining the computational properties needed for
calculation.
