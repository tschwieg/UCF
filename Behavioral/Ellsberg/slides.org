* Uncertainty
** How much uncertainty is there?
- Even though Knight claims uncertainty dominates, people tend to
  behave "as if" they have numerical probabilities assigned to events.
- Shackle's Cricket Match
- Can we provide odds we are willing to back?

** 
- "The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong,
  but that's the way to bet." - Damon Runyon
- Do these bets reveal anything about our "hidden probabilities?"
- If this were possible, we could turn these uncertainties that people
  were willing to bet on, and transform them into something alike
  risk.

** Enter Savage
- Savage claims that for someone who is "rational" all uncertainties
  can be reduced into risks.
- A willingness to bet on 2:1 odds means a belief in a probability of
  $\frac{1}{3}$ 
- Must still somehow untangle probabilities from preferences, but in a
  controlled setting this is feasible. 
- What does "rational" mean?

** What can we infer from behavior?
- What does indifference between two gambles imply?
- Equal probabilities, given you assigned probabilities.
- May just be attempting to mimimax - this only reflects they have the
  same worst-case. 
- Seek an operator $\mathcircled { \geq }$ - Qualitative Probability

** What the operator gives us:
- $\mathcircled { \geq }$ is a complete ordering among events
- If an event \alpha is more probable than \beta, then $\bar{\alpha}$ is less
  probable than $\bar{\beta}$. 
- If \alpha and \gamma are mutually exclusive and so are \beta and \gamma, then if \alpha is
  more probable than \beta, $\alpha \cup \gamma$ is more probable than $\beta \cup \gamma$
- Under the Savage axioms, $\mathcircled { \geq }$ holds these
  properties.

** The Savage axioms
- Gambles have a complete ordering
- If two gambles have the same payoff, its value is irrelevant.
- Dominated Actions are always rejected - "noncontroversial"
- Choice in a gamble is independent of the relative magnitudes of the
  rewards, only the ranking.

 Size of the prize doesn't affect choice.

** What happens when these are not fulfilled?
- We cannot infer probabilities from actions
- There is no VNM Utility function that we can apply.
- These are not met in a particular class of situations
- These situations are where ambiguity rules.

* Do the Axioms Apply? 
** Experiment Time
- Which would you prefer to bet on?
| Box I  | 10 Red M&Ms, 10 Green M&Ms            |
| Box II | 20 M&Ms All of which are Red or Green |
- Red M&M or Green M&M from Box I?
- Red M&M or Green M&M from Box II?
- Red M&M from Box I or Red from BoxII?
- Green from Box I or Green from BoxII?

** Honey I broke the axioms
- Preferring Box I to Box II in both violates the savage axioms.
- If you prefer Box I Red, then you must view it as more probable, and
  therefore Box I Green as less probable than Box II Green.
- However you also prefer Box II Green to Box I Green, and we have a
  contradiction. 

** Do we really have total ignorance?
- Lets take a few samples out of Box II.
- Have your preferences for betting changed?
- This is typical, and it only changes willingness to bet slightly.

** Another Experiment
- There are 20 known blue M&Ms, and forty M&Ms that are all red or
  green.
| Bet on Blue          | Bet on Red           |
| Bet on Blue or Green | Bet on Red or Green  |
- When the ambiguity is removed by Red or Green being an option, it is
  suddenly the preferred case.
- Sophisticated individuals still continue to violate the axioms even
  on reflection with the notion they are violating them.

* Ambiguity
** Standard uncertainty behaviors
- Individuals are not minimaxing purely. 
- Nor are they maximizing any weighted average of the best and worst
  case. 
- They aren't even minimaxing regret, as these examples are designed
  so that their regret would be identical.
- Yet these choices are fairly obvious and intuitive.

** Ambiguity Aversion
- We have some information about the problem, but we just aren't sure
  how good our information is.
- However we aren't "completely ignorant" so common techniques for
  handling uncertainty don't apply either. 
- Limited to distributions $(\frac{1}{3}, \lambda, \frac{2}{3} - \lambda)$.
- No real knowledge of which of these distributions is more "likely"
- This is different from the uninformed prior!

** Further Problems
- Even if an individual could assign relative weights to each possible
  distribution and apply a prior, he does not know how useful the data
  is.
- Information can still be ambiguous, for example hearing about a
  players' FG% in basketball may inform you on their chances in the
  playoffs this year more or less depending on your knowledge. 
- This cannot be expressed in terms of likelihoods.

** Where does ambiguity apply?
- Where information can often be unreliable.
- New processes. (Vegas Games rely on the same stochastic devices).
- Returning to the Cricket Game:

 You would be certain to bet on who bats first

 How certain are you on betting on who wins the game?

** A possible Computational Device
- It is possible that maybe there is an expected distribution (prior),
  but since the individual is not certain that he is correct, he
  weights it against the worst possible case. 
- Ellsberg uses a linear combination for simplicity, but it could be
  more complex.
- Provides nothing more than a heuristic.
- No formal model presented.


** How does this predict behavior?
- When we are less sure of our predictions, we become more
  conservative. 
- A bet on known things is preferred to a bet on unknown odds.
- This doesn't mean that people are not acting optimally, nor are they
  being "irrational"
